### **Meal Planning Logic**  
- Prompts the user for **days they will eat out** and **days they will be in the office**.  
- Generates a **weekly meal plan** for lunches and dinners.  
- **Office lunch logic**:  
  - If **yesterdayâ€™s dinner** was **leftover-friendly**, today's **lunch will be leftovers**.  
  - If today is an **office day**, leftovers count as an **office lunch**.  
  - Otherwise, lunch is chosen randomly from available options.  
- **Dinner logic**:  
  - If **tomorrow is an office day**, tonightâ€™s dinner is **50% more likely** to be **leftover-friendly**.  
  - If **today is an office day**, tonightâ€™s dinner will be **lazy** (quick to prepare).  
  - Otherwise, dinner is chosen randomly.  
- Ensures a **mix of regular, lazy, and leftover-friendly meals**.  
- Prints the **final meal plan** and a **shopping list** with needed ingredients.  

This approach balances **effort, variety, and convenience**, making meal prep easier while ensuring you have food for the office! ðŸš€
